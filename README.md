# Blueberry-Yield-Prediction-using-PyTorch-Kaggle-Competition-

##### In this Kaggle Competition, I utilized PyTorch to create a neural network that predicts wild blueberry yield based on ~15 features. Doing so landed me in the top 20% of Kaggle submissions. My code should be self-explanatory, and I have included the data sets in the repo as well.
